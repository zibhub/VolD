/**
 * Interface for directory backends usage.
 *
 * A partitioned directory offers the possibility to store a set of values in a
 * certain directory of a certain partition. The content of a single directory
 * (key) can then be queried. Furthermore, the content of all directories
 * starting with a given prefix can be queried.
 *
 * Backends implementing this interface are used by the VolatileDirectory
 *
 * @note        Although the values are given in lists, some implementations have a
 *              set semantic here.
 * @note        The two words key and directory are used as synonyms here.
